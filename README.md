## Who I am

My name is Keneilwe Keraetswe by appearance I am tall brown skinned girl, am quite talkative, friendly to those who know me by the way most people would say I look quite, which is not true as I come out reserved and shy. Well I do not really interact in social life such as partying, I enjoy my own space as I believe we all have choices of how we want to be live, and I cannot be pressured to do something just because other people in my 'age' do. I can tolerate my anger, but whenever it reach to a point where a person persist of misbehavior to piss me of  will just ignore him or her, even cry in my own space. I may be confident but sometimes I don’t see myself as others see me, we live in a world where there some areas we don’t know of.

## Where i come from

I grew in a small village town where crime and gang violence are on every corner. I come from a big family of aunt grannies and siblings so you can imagine how big it is, I cannot say we are poor but we never had to sleep hungry.
